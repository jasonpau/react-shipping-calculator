## React Shipping Calculator

Rebuilt my initial shipping calculator project into a single-page React app. The state is set up within the main App component, while the shipping speed radio buttons are set up as individual components that send their interactions back to the parent App. The results of the calculations are displayed in a stateless functional component. The actual business logic is imported from a separate JavaScript file.
